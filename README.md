# MyDocuments
MyDocuments accepts images, pdf, csv, and docx. After a successful upload, mail will be sent to user. 

Registration do not allow duplicate email address. The database name is MyDocuments and I have also included the SQL commands for creating the tables. 
The folder also contains Access Database file.

There are three pages.
1. Home (New registrations happens on home page)
2. Upload (Files are uploaded on this page)
3. Documents (You can see all uploaded documents and also search by Email or Transaction ID)
